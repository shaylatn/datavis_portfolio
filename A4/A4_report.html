      <h2>Proposition: The standard of living has increased for everyone.</h2>

        <h3>FOR the Proposition</h3>

            This is a line chart showing the average poverty gap at $5.50 across
            the world. We can see that it decreases significantly across the
            years, and thus indicating that people are having on average a
            better standard of living.
          </figcaption>

        <p>Design Decisions and Rationale:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            I cut off the data to begin at 1980. This is because prior to 1980,
            the chart did not follow the trend as strongly, so to create the
            largest visual decrease, I cut the range. I would give this a score
            of 1 since it is pretty representative of the data with minimal
            filtering.
          </li>
          <li>
            I used data from all countries. This makes it more representative of
            the total world population and allows readers to make general trends
            which gives it s core of 2.
          </li>
          <li>
            Looking at it now, I wish I added some label data points to
            emphasize high and low points in the line graph. Since the trend is
            already pretty clear, this would only help to emphasize it, not
            really adding any deceptiveness and thus grant a score of 1.5.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>AGAINST the Proposition</h3>

        <figure>
          <img src="../images/A4_against.png" alt="" width="500" />
          <figcaption>
            This chart shows the increase in the percentage of income that the
            top 10% of the population holds. This refutes the proposition since
            overall population isn't necessarily holding more income as it is
            maining in the hands of the top percentile and is continuing to
            increase.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>Design Decisions and Rationale:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            I filtered out several countries in order to get this trend in order
            to show that world population data cannot generalize to individual
            countries. I would give this a score of -1 since I purposefully
            filtered that data to only include specific countries.
          </li>
          <li>
            In the title of the graph, I don't specify the population which
            again allows me to cherry pick countries that supports the claim.
            This scores -.5 since it acts as an accomplice to the first design
            choice.
          </li>
          <li>
            Additionally, I did not color code the points as to not show what
            countries they are from/represent. Once again, this just furthers
            the decpetion that the data is not representative of the whole
            population. Score: -1
          </li>
          <li>
            Ideally, I wanted to have some type of histogram to show the
            percentage or income buckets that the population fell in in order to
            show that most of the wealth is only handled by a few which would
            negate the fact that overall standard of living is increasing, but I
            was not able to find the right measures and dimensions to do so.
          </li>

        <h2>Final Reflection</h2>

        <p>
          Overall, I felt this was extremely difficult for me to find evidence
          for oppsing sides of an opposition. I wanted to utilize Simpson's
          Paradox and find trends that didn't hold when the population was
          divided, but due to the large datasets, it was very difficult to find
          these subpopulations. A simple tactic that I noticed was that if one
          part of the timeline didnt support your claim, you could (relatively
          easily) just cut that time out of your data.
        </p>
        <p>
          With regards to my visualizations, I found that most of the data was
          able to support my proposition with minimal changes. Thus my 'for'
          visualization is a pretty straight forward representation of the data.
          However, becasue of this, it was extremely difficult to make my
          against visualization. I tried to use different measures that could
          still imply standrad of living but most followed the same trends. Then
          I tried excluding a few of the top 1st world countries but still
          couldn't make much progress. The deception techniques that I used in
          my second visualization can be misleading, but they can also be
          beneficial depending on the argument that is made. It is deceptive if
          one wants to make a generalization on the whole world population.
          However, a part of the reason I used it was to indicate that
          generalizations on the world are not necessarily applicable on a
          country basis, and thus this second visual shows that for the
          countries included, most of the wealth is held by a small population.
        </p>
        <p>
          I believe that ethical design visualization doesn't pick and choose
          what data they want to include. It's okay to maybe exclude a specific
          population but not to cheery pick data points that don't support the
          claim which can lead to lots of misinformation. I also believe its
          very important to identify the population you want to make conclusions
          about since oftentimes subpopulation data cannot be generalized to a
          larger overall population and vice versa.
