        <h3>Overall Analysis Questions</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            What are the income differences between largely single family zoned
            areas and other housing areas? In some of the readings from A1, it
            stated that single family housing is typically advertised for older,
            middle to upper class families, so I wanted to see what this income
            gap looked like.
          </li>
          <li>
            Which racial demographics are most prevalent in Massachusetts?
            Historically, I know there have been zoning laws made to exclude
            certain demographics from living in an area, so I wanted to see if
            there were any trends.
          </li>
          <li>
            What is the age distribution of each type of housing area? From the
            reading it seemed like inner cities like NY had more dense housing.
            I feel like younger individuals often live in inner cities while
            older adults with families tend to move to the suburbs where there
            are more single family homes.

        <h2>Discoveries & Insights</h2>
        <p>
          I first wanted to assess the quality of the data. Taking a skim
          through the datasheet, I thought the data looked pretty reasonable. My
          only concern is that the total household data differs that that from
          the population data. This is stated in the metadata; however, it's
          good to keep in mind moving forward as different metrics may not be
          entirely proportional to each other. Also, for the purposes of showing
          trends, I will not be able to display all of the data as there are so
          many cities and I cannot capture all of the information in one image.

          <figcaption>
            These visualizations help to answer my first question of, what are
            the income differences between largely single family zoned areas and
            other housing areas? This graph shows the proportion of each city
            whose household income is, from bottom to top, under 25K, 25-50K,
            50-75K, 75-100K, 100-200K, and 200K+. Each city is also split
            between areas of single family housing, denoted by a 1, and non
            single family housing denoted by a 0. You can see the trend that in
            cities that have both only single family and non single family
            housing areas, the only single family areas tend to have an equal or
            higher percentage of high income earners. Comparing areas within a
            city as opposed to cities aginst each other helps to reduce
            confoudning variables of jurisdiction lines and income
            discrimination across cities. Thus, we can conclude from this that
            families living in only single family housing areas tend to be more
            waelthy than those who don't.

            I wanted to learn about Massachusetts' racial demographics. In this
            multi bar chart, you can see the racial distribution for each city
            in Massachusetts. The categories are White, African American (aa),
            Asian (as), Latino (lat), and other. I grouped Native Americans,
            Pacific Islanders, multiracial, and other all into one category of
            other because their individual proportions were very insignificant
            comapred to other values. We can see that for most municipalities,
            white is the dominating demograhic; however, there are some
            municipalities such as Chelsea, Randolph, and even Quincy, that have
            a much higher minority population than others. This led me to ask
            myself if there were any other trends based on race.

          <img src="../images/q2_b.png" alt="" width="500px" />
          <figcaption>
            I then looked into the relationship between % population that is
            white and only single family housing. We can see in the plot that in
            majoroty of the municipalities that have only single family areas,
            these areas have a large proportion of white residents, with most of
            these areas being over 75% white. On the other side, the areas that
            are non single family housing tendd to have a wider range and
            vareity of percentages. We can use this to conclude that there does
            exist some relation between racial demographic and housing type.

        <figure>
          <img src="../images/q3.png" alt="" width="500px" />
          <figcaption>
            Lastly, to explore my last question, I graphed the age distribution
            of each city. This is another point in which I found a quality issue
            in the data. The data groups all 18-65 year olds together in one
            bin, which is extremely uninformative to learn about age trends in
            different housing.Being under 18 is not helpful as these residents
            are most likely dependents of their families. By combining every
            ages 18-65, we lose information about different generations of
            people and young adults without families versus older adults with
            children. Ultimately, we can see that every city is dominated by
            those 18-65, but with such a large range, this isn't a surprise, but
            there is nothing in the data to look deeper into this area.

        <h2>Summary</h2>

        <p>
          In this exploratory data analysis, we explore trends about single
          family housing across Massachusetts. We are able to see census data
          from Massachusetts municipalities and specifically draw conclusions
          from income and racial demographic information. Though very
          informative in some aspects, the data lacks specifc information on age
          which I believe could be extremely beneficial to study as people in
          different age groups have very different mindsets and tend to fall in
          unique income and lifestyle buckets.
