        <h2>Phase One: Sketching Visualizations</h2>

        <figure>
          <img src="../images/pie.png" alt="" width="500" />
          <figcaption>
            This is a nested pie chart depicting the age distributions of the US
            population in 1900 and 2000. The inner pie chart is of 1900 and the
            outer is of 2000. The population is divided into 10 year age
            increments.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>Design Rationale for Sketch 1:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            I wanted to see a side by side comparison of the age proportions
          </li>
          <li>
            It is easy to compare slice sizes and subsets of age groups between
            the years
          </li>
          <li>Important points such as 25% or 50% are easily identifiable</li>
          <li>
            Outer slices may "appear" larger than inner slices due to having a
            larger radius which could mislead population size
          </li>
          <li>
            This allows us to see proportions really well but I would love to
            also see the counts.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <figure>
          <img src="../images/bar.png" alt="" width="500" />
          <figcaption>
            This is a stacked bar chart showing the population count for each
            age in each year, 1900 and 2000. The population is divided into 10
            year age increments.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>Design Rationale for Sketch 2:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            This better depicts overall change in population as well as age
            group changes from 1900 to 2000
          </li>
          <li>
            It maintains some of the proportionality benefits. You can see what
            proportion of the population a certain age group takes up.
          </li>
          <li>
            It is more difficult to compare proportions across the years since
            the heights of the bars are different.
          </li>
          <li>
            It provides a visualization of cumulative counts but its difficult
            to determine the individual counts of each age group.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <figure>
          <img src="../images/scatterplot.png" alt="" width="500" />
          <figcaption>
            This is a scatter plot showing the population count of each age
            group, split into 10 year age increments. Red indicates 1900 and
            blue indicates 2000.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>Design Rationale for Sketch 3:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>It shows the count of each age group for each year.</li>
          <li>You can see which groups had the biggest change.</li>
          <li>
            I wish I added some line between the points for each year so we
            could visually compare the sizes of the lines across age groups.
          </li>
          <li>
            The graph is very simple and doesn't show much more than the
            datasheet tells us.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Overall, each sketch has its pros and cons. I made each successive
          sketch after finding something wrong with the current iteration.
          However, with adding a new feature means I would sacrifice a benefit
          of the previous sketch. I believe they're all good for different use
          cases. If you didn't care about the actual size of the population and
          more just the age distribution then I would use the double pie chart
          as the stacked nature of it allows for very easy comparisons and
          estimations. However, if the differences in population is important to
          you then I would use the stacked bar chart as opposed to the scatter
          plot. This is because the information in the scatterplot can be found
          in the stack bars with a little bit of math (subtracting the bottom
          boundary from the top). It visualizes population differences while
          also giving you an idea of what the age distribution of a given year
          looks like.

        <h2>Phase Two: Final Design</h2>

        <figure>
          <img src="../images/final_pie.png" alt="" width="500" />
          <figcaption>
            This is a stacked double pie chart that shows the age distribution
            of the population in 1900 and 2000. The age groups are divided into
            10 year increments.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Design Process & Design Decisions</h2>

        <p>
          For my design process, I wanted to emphasize proportions over the
          actual population count. We know that population has increased
          overtime but this can happen in many ways. The population can increase
          proportionally, with the same fraction of people landing in each
          bucket or we could see a trend that over the 100 years people tend to
          live shorter or longer and in this case, we can see that they got
          older.
        </p>
        <p>
          I decided to use a pie chart as opposed to the stacked bar chart
          because going around the circle, we know exactly how much is one
          whole, as opposed to the bar chart where it can be various heights
          which makes comparing proportion slices more difficult. With the pie
          chart, if the slice lines line up then you know those are equal
          proportionally. Additionally, I ordered the slices in increasing age
          order starting at the positive y axis and going around. This is so we
          can subset adjacent age groups so we can see if the population is
          generally young or old without having to add up disconnected slices.
          Since both pie charts go in the same order, we can comapre age groups
          between the two years.
        </p>

        <h3>Reflection</h3>

        <p>
          Phase 1 helped me to creatively think of ways to visualize a simple
          dataset. Since the dataset wasn't complex, I was able to focus more on
          the visualizations to represent it instead of trying to pick out which
          parts of the data I want. I also liked how my different iterations of
          phase 1 nuilt upon eachother, continuing to answer new questions the
          arose, thus giving me different options if my focus question were to
          vary. I believe my first sketch best represents my question of "how
          did the age distribution differ from 1900 to 2000" pretty well and
          allows a reader to focus on the proportions which is why I chose to
          create it.
